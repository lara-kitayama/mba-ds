# Countries Clustering Project

## Overview
This project focuses on clustering countries based on various economic, geographical, and social parameters. The goal is to identify patterns and group countries that exhibit similar characteristics, thereby providing insights into global trends and helping in decision-making processes.

## Objectives
- To analyze datasets containing country-level statistics.
- To apply clustering algorithms to categorize countries.
- To visualize the results for better interpretation.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes data from international organizations such as:
- World Bank
- United Nations
- International Monetary Fund (IMF)

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gather relevant datasets from various sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. Clustering Techniques: Apply various clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, etc.
4. Evaluation: Use metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering.
5. Visualization: Create visual representations of the clusters.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into how countries can be grouped based on clustered data, potentially revealing hidden correlations and trends that would not be apparent from isolated data points.
